Additive Color Model is an RGB color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.

# USES:
The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic
systems, such as televisions and computers.

The programming language used here is C using OpenGL libraries. 

In this project, we are demonstrating the formation of additive color in which there are three circles present at three different places on the window. 
The circles are of three colors is Red, Green, Blue.

As the user presses the left mouse button the circles will move towards the center and will form the additive color model. 
As the user presses the right mouse button the menu option gets displays. The menu contains the options like move,reset,exit,rotate,RGB,GRB,GBR etc.
The rotate option contains sub-menu like rotate fast and rotate slowly which is used to change the speed of rotation.
